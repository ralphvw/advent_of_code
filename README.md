# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.

## Description

These are my Python solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles. The Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming challenges throughout December.

## Structure

- Each day's solution is organized into its own folder (e.g., `01_Day`, `02_Day`, etc.).
- Within each folder, you'll find the Python script containing the solution code.
- Some folders might contain additional resources or input files used by the code.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions for each day. To run a specific solution, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the Python script in your preferred environment.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my personal attempts at solving the Advent of Code challenges. They might not always represent the most optimized or efficient solutions. I encourage you to solve the challenges on your own before exploring others' solutions.
